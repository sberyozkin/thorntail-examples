= Resource Adapter Example

Resource adapters can be configured in two
different ways within a Thorntail application.

The first is through a *deployment*, which is, as you might
guess, a deployment-time creation of a resource adapter. Through
deployments you must provide an ironjacamar.xml file. This a file
very similar to a ra.xml.

The second is through *fraction configuration*, which is
at a slightly higher level, tied to the container configuration.

While both can result in the same functionality, there is not
any particular difference between them other than how you package
your application and if you want to work with JBoss Modules
`module.xml` descriptors.
